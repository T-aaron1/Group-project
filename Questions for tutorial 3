Should we include isoforms of kinases within the database?

We came across different values for genome start and end across both uniprot and enzemble and wasnt sure whether to include the values from one database or the other. 
Can we justify coosing ensemble over uniprot because ensemble goves us the genomic sequence as a valid justification ovr uniprot??\
