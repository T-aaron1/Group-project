Our site is able to accept and process quantitative phosphoproteomics data in a tab-separated values file format (.tsv) only. The desired phosphoproteomics dataset to be uploaded on our site must be structured in a specific format. An example of an acceptable .tsv file structure can be found below:Using the KSEA (Kinase Substrate Enrichment Analysis) formula allows our site computationally to infer relative kinase activity from quantitative phosphoproteomics data & have it summarised graphically. Scores are generated for each kinase according to the relative hyper-phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of the majority of its substrates. With this score we are able to determine the overall activity for each kinase relative to the control and obtain statistical P-values from the uploaded file to create interactive graphical analysis of the dataset. More information about this can be found in https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/21/3489/3892392
