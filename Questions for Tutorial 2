1. Do we retrieve all inhibitors or just FDA approved inhibitors?
2. The kinases that have a family of 'other', should we leave this as it is or find the specific family names?
(for example, when looking up one of the 'other' family kinases, Uniprot showed it belonged to the 'ubiquitin-like' family, should we replace 'other' with this or leave it as it is)
