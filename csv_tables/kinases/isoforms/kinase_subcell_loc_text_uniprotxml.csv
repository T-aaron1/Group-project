P31749|Nucleus after activation by integrin-linked protein kinase 1 (ILK1). Nuclear translocation is enhanced by interaction with TCL1A. Phosphorylation on Tyr-176 by TNK2 results in its localization to the cell membrane where it is targeted for further phosphorylations on Thr-308 and Ser-473 leading to its activation and the activated form translocates to the nucleus. Colocalizes with WDFY2 in intracellular vesicles (PubMed:16792529).|41

O15530|Tyrosine phosphorylation seems to occur only at the cell membrane. Translocates to the cell membrane following insulin stimulation by a mechanism that involves binding to GRB14 and INSR. SRC and HSP90 promote its localization to the cell membrane. Its nuclear localization is dependent on its association with PTPN6 and its phosphorylation at Ser-396. Restricted to the nucleus in neuronal cells while in non-neuronal cells it is found in the cytoplasm. The Ser-241 phosphorylated form is distributed along the perinuclear region in neuronal cells while in non-neuronal cells it is found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. IGF1 transiently increases phosphorylation at Ser-241 of neuronal PDPK1, resulting in its translocation to other cellular compartments. The tyrosine-phosphorylated form colocalizes with PTK2B in focal adhesions after angiotensin II stimulation.|

In proliferating cells, it shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm in synchrony with the cell cycle, and in serum/growth factor-stimulated cells it resides in the nucleus. In contrast, after exposure to environmental stress or treatment with glucocorticoids, it is detected in the cytoplasm and with certain stress conditions is associated with the mitochondria. In osmoregulation through the epithelial sodium channel, it can be localized to the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane. Nuclear, upon phosphorylation.|

Q00535|In axonal growth cone with extension to the peripheral lamellipodia (By similarity). Under neurotoxic stress and neuronal injury conditions, CDK5R (p35) is cleaved by calpain to generate CDK5R1 (p25) in response to increased intracellular calcium. The elevated level of p25, when in complex with CDK5, leads to its subcellular misallocation as well as its hyperactivation. Colocalizes with CTNND2 in the cell body of neuronal cells, and with CTNNB1 in the cell-cell contacts and plasma membrane of undifferentiated and differentiated neuroblastoma cells. Reversibly attached to the plasma membrane in an inactive form when complexed to dephosphorylated p35 or CDK5R2 (p39), p35 phosphorylation releases this attachment and activates CDK5.|7

Q06187|In steady state, BTK is predominantly cytosolic. Following B-cell receptor (BCR) engagement by antigen, translocates to the plasma membrane through its PH domain. Plasma membrane localization is a critical step in the activation of BTK. A fraction of BTK also shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and nuclear export is mediated by the nuclear export receptor CRM1.|
