P37173|Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 6|The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry.|An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term suspected HNPCC or incomplete HNPCC can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected.

The etiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is likely to be multifactorial, involving both genetic and environmental factors. The disease is inherited in 5-10% of the cases.
P07332||Has been shown to act as proto-oncogene in some types of cancer, possibly due to abnormal activation of the kinase. Has been shown to act as tumor suppressor in other types of cancer.

Hypogonadism is due to deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone and probably results from a failure of embryonic migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as Kallmann syndrome, whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH).

Most GISTs are composed of a fairly uniform population of spindle-shaped cells. Some tumors are dominated by epithelioid cells or contain a mixture of spindle and epithelioid morphologies. Primary GISTs in the gastrointestinal tract commonly metastasize in the omentum and mesenteries, often as multiple nodules. However, primary tumors may also occur outside of the gastrointestinal tract, in other intra-abdominal locations, especially in the omentum and mesentery.

The neuropathological hallmark of the disease is vascular and pericapillary calcification, mainly of calcium phosphate, in the affected brain areas.
P09619|Myofibromatosis, infantile 1 |The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry.|A rare mesenchymal disorder characterized by the development of benign tumors in the skin, striated muscles, bones, and, more rarely, visceral organs. Subcutaneous or soft tissue nodules commonly involve the skin of the head, neck, and trunk. Skeletal and muscular lesions occur in about half of the patients. Lesions may be solitary or multicentric, and they may be present at birth or become apparent in early infancy or occasionally in adult life. Visceral lesions are associated with high morbidity and mortality.

P42336||PIK3CA mutations are involved in various type of cancer. Most of the cancer-associated mutations are missense mutations and map to one of the three hotspots: Glu-542; Glu-545 and His-1047. Mutated isoforms participate in cellular transformation and tumorigenesis induced by oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and HRAS/KRAS.

The protein kinase activity may not be required for tumorigenesis.|
